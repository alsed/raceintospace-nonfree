# Race into Space nonfree data

Race into Space game was open-sourced under GPLv2 license,
but the music files were requested to stay non-commercial use data only.
Therefore these files are only usable for the Race into Space game (or its 
derivations).

These files are not free software content.
They are still available free of charge, but for non-commercial purposes only.

* The current music files are in the `data/audio` folder.  
* There is also a `legacy` folder that contains previously used music files 
in `midi` and `ogg-mono` formats.
* The folder `ris-music` contains stereo high quality non-edited 
music files.

<br>
To include music in the game, copy `data/audio` directory to:

* in the source code directory - if you're building the game from 
source, or  
* in the directory where you installed the game.
